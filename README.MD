A simple ruby tool, that:
- Finds out all of HackBulgaria's particiapnts .git files on github (generates them from a list).
- Clones their repos in a folder of my choosing.
- Descends recursively in the directory of every participant, finds all the java files relevant to Exam1, and concatenates them all in one All.java file.

This way I only have to look at the All.java file, and not throuh each file individually. For 50 people's solutions to check, this does in fact matter.
